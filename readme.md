## The front end test 

To run it locally go to the command line and type `node app.js`

You probably also want to 'npm install' all the things first

When that fails, you probably want to `sudo npm install` all the things.

Here's a handy alias for next time that happens:

  alias ffs=sudo !!


To run the tests, go the command line and type `mocha`


Deploy it to Nodejitsu if you want.  It's currently up here:
