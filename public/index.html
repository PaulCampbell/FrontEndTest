        Artists web service
	</h1>
        <p>
            a json webservice can be found: <br><br>
            <a href="/api/v1/artists.json">/api/v1/artists.json</a>

        </p>
<p>The service supports jsonp by making a request to any endpoint with a callback query string parameter:
    <br><br>
   <a href="/api/v1/artists.json?callback=MyCallback">/api/v1/artists.json?callback=MyCallback</a>
</p>

    <p>
        Artist resources can be updated by putting a json payload to the artist endpoint:

        PUT: /api/v1/artists/1.json
        <br>
        <br>
        A successful PUT will result in a 200 response.
    </p>

    <h2>Write a test-driven Discography JQuery plugin</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Use the data published here: http://pcampbellem-test.nodejitsu.com/api/v1/artists.json<br/>
            When loaded, the plugin should render a clickable list of artist names</li>
        <li> A user should be able edit the list by adding wikipedia URLs for each artist. <br/>
            (The service will not persist the update immediately, but the app should be capable of making PUT update requests)</li>
        <li> When an artist name link is clicked then the list of albums for that artist should be displayed</li>
